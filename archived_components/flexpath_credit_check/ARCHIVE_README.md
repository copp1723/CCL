# FlexPath Credit Check Components - ARCHIVED

## Archive Date
June 5, 2025

## Reason for Archive
FlexPath integration postponed until they are ready for implementation. Components archived to reduce code bloat and prevent error-prone configurations.

## Archived Components

### Files Moved to Archive
1. `server/services/external-apis.ts` - FlexPath API service integration
2. `server/agents/CreditCheckAgent.ts` - AI agent for credit check processing

### Database Schema Changes
- Removed `creditChecks` table from schema
- Removed `creditCheckId` foreign key from `leads` table
- Removed related insert schemas and type definitions

### Agent System Updates
- Removed CreditCheckAgent from active agent list
- Updated agent IDs to maintain sequential numbering
- Simplified agent count from 5 to 4 active agents

## Current Active Agents (Post-Archive)
1. VisitorIdentifierAgent - Detects abandoned applications
2. RealtimeChatAgent - Handles live customer chat
3. EmailReengagementAgent - Sends personalized email campaigns
4. LeadPackagingAgent - Packages leads for dealer submission

## FlexPath Integration Capabilities (Archived)

### API Integration Features
- Soft credit pull functionality
- Risk tier assessment (prime, near-prime, sub-prime, deep-sub-prime)
- Loan amount estimation
- Interest rate calculation
- Decline reason analysis
- Simulation mode for testing without API keys

### Credit Check Agent Features
- Phone number validation (E.164 format)
- Result caching (5-minute cache duration)
- Approval event emission
- Activity logging for audit trail
- Integration with visitor tracking

### Database Schema (Removed)
```sql
creditChecks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  visitor_id INTEGER REFERENCES visitors(id),
  phone TEXT NOT NULL,
  credit_score INTEGER,
  approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  external_id TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

## Restoration Instructions

### When FlexPath is Ready
1. Restore files from this archive directory
2. Update database schema to include creditChecks table
3. Run database migration: `npm run db:push`
4. Add CreditCheckAgent back to agent initialization
5. Update agent count and IDs in storage system
6. Restore credit check endpoints in API routes
7. Update frontend components to handle credit check status

### Environment Variables Required
- `FLEXPATH_API_KEY` - Production API key from FlexPath
- `FLEXPATH_BASE_URL` - API endpoint (defaults to sandbox)

### Testing Requirements
- Verify credit check simulation mode works without API key
- Test phone number validation and formatting
- Confirm result caching functionality
- Validate database persistence of credit check results
- Test handoff flow from chat agent to credit agent

## System Impact of Archive

### Positive Impacts
- Reduced code complexity and maintenance burden
- Eliminated potential errors from unused FlexPath configuration
- Cleaner system architecture focused on active functionality
- Faster deployment and testing cycles

### Functionality Maintained
- Lead processing and email automation continue unaffected
- Visitor tracking and chat functionality preserved
- Database persistence and security features intact
- All core business processes operational

### Future Considerations
- FlexPath integration can be restored when ready
- No breaking changes to existing lead processing workflow
- Credit check functionality can be added as enhancement
- Current system supports leads without credit requirements
