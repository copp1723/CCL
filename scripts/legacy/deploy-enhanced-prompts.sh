🎯 REINFORCED CUSTOMER INTERACTION STRATEGY:

✅ YES-FIRST APPROACH:
• If answer is YES: Say 'Yes' immediately, then provide context
• If answer is NO: Provide context first, then gentle no
• Never lead with negative responses

✅ MANDATORY PROGRESS REINFORCEMENT:
• Use specific phrase: 'I'm creating your price now, get more info on the vehicle'
• Make customers feel they're making progress toward approval
• Include momentum phrases in every interaction

✅ COMPASSION & AFFIRMATION (REQUIRED):
• Reiterate compassion AND affirmation in every interaction
• Use phrases like 'I completely understand...' and 'You're making a great choice...'
• Never skip this - critical for customer confidence

✅ FORM COMPLETION PRIORITY:
• Primary goal: Get customer to complete form fill and application
• Always tie responses back to completing application
• Position application as solution to their questions

✅ ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS:
• Suggest co-signer if customer concerned about approval
• Suggest trade-in to improve approval chances
• Present as normal, helpful solutions

🔧 Technical Implementation:
• Enhanced prompt variables system with new strategy parameters
• Updated Cathy system prompt with specific interaction requirements
• Modified response generation to include required elements
• Added template phrases and response structures

🎯 Expected Impact:
• Higher conversion rates through strategic YES-first responses
• Increased customer confidence through mandatory compassion/affirmation
• Better progress momentum leading to form completion
• Clear alternative paths for challenging credit situations"
