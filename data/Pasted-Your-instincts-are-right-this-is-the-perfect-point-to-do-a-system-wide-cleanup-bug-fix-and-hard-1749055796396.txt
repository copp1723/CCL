Your instincts are right—**this is the perfect point to do a system-wide cleanup, bug fix, and “harden before feature creep” sprint**. You’re at the inflection where technical debt can either get locked down or start piling up. Here’s a clear action plan:

---

## 1. **Full Cleanup & Error Hardening (Recommended Next Step)**

**Why:**

* You’ve already proven core flows work (and you’ve caught 1/6 “happy path” failures—now is when you want to fix them, not later when the system is 2x bigger).
* This sets you up for smooth demos, stakeholder trust, and zero-surprise production pilots.

### Cleanup/Hygiene Checklist

* **Error Review:**

  * Go through logs and the testing dashboard for every failed/partial “happy path” or edge-case scenario.
  * Triage: Which errors are “noise” (harmless but noisy), “expected” (user-caused), or real bugs?
  * Clean up error messaging everywhere (no stack traces, no ambiguous “something went wrong”—everything should be human-readable, logged with context, and, where appropriate, actionable).

* **Code & Agent Hygiene:**

  * Remove dead/test code, unused agents, and outdated data fields from the schema.
  * Standardize all agent input/output contracts and make sure schema validation is strict.
  * Audit permissions—make sure admin/ops roles can’t accidentally see or change what they shouldn’t.
  * Confirm all API keys/secrets are in secure storage and not hard-coded anywhere.

* **Metrics and Reporting:**

  * Review all latency and error counters—calibrate thresholds for “warn” and “critical.”
  * Ensure failure reasons are categorized (network, agent timeout, bad input, external API, etc.).

* **Testing:**

  * Rerun all scenario scripts after each fix/cleanup.
  * Add at least one “destructive” scenario (e.g., simulate external API outage or intentionally trigger email delivery failure).

* **Docs/Hand-off:**

  * Summarize known issues (if any), open questions, and “resolved” vs. “won’t fix” bug log.
  * Clean up the README or internal onboarding doc to reflect current real-world system, not just design intent.

## 2. **Then… Re-Demo and Decide**

* Run a “show me what breaks” session (with a non-dev or future ops user if possible).
* Confirm every critical metric and workflow is green. Any “red”/partial passes should be explained and assigned.

**When the system can survive a hostile demo, you’re ready to:**

* Invite external testers (dealerships, execs, partners)
* Scale to next batch of features (advanced reporting, new data integrations, SMS channel, etc.)
* Move toward first real production pilot.

**TL;DR:**
**Pause for a thorough error/burndown and code hygiene sprint, then re-demo.**
This will massively de-risk the project, let you ship with confidence, and keep your platform maintainable.

**If you want, I can give you a structured QA checklist, bug triage matrix, or even a demo playbook for the next phase—just ask.**
