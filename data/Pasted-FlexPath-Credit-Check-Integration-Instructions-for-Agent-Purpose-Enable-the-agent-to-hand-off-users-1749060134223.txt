FlexPath Credit Check Integration Instructions for Agent
Purpose:
Enable the agent to hand off users to the FlexPath pre-qualification experience via a dynamically generated link, with full attribution and correct environment.

1. When to Generate a FlexPath Link
Whenever a user is ready for a credit check or pre-qualification, the agent must generate a FlexPath link and deliver it as part of the conversation (chat, email, or SMS).

The agent must only generate the link if all required information is available.

2. Required Inputs for FlexPath Link Generation
dealerKey: (string, required)
Unique install key for the dealer or website.

flow: (string, required)
Specifies the FlexPath product flow.

"GPQ" (Get Pre-Qualified): for general credit checks (default)

"SI" (Single Vehicle Payment): for inventory-specific pre-qualification (requires iidStub)

iidStub: (string, conditionally required)
Inventory identifier (VIN or stock number).

Required if flow="SI".

Optional for other flows.

phone: (string, optional)
Prospect’s phone number, formatted as 234-567-8910 if available (no country code).

entry: (string, optional)
Channel/source that initiated the FlexPath launch (e.g., CH for chat, EM for email, HP for homepage).

from: (string, optional)
Where the user was engaged (e.g., homepage, inventory page, email, etc.)

launch: (string/URL, optional)
Specific page/location when launching FlexPath; if provided as a URL, user will be redirected there when exiting FlexPath.

Other optional params:
Any additional campaign, attribution, or tracking info as required.

3. Determine the FlexPath Environment
If in “production” mode:
Use https://app.flexpathdxp.com/

If in “demo” or “test” mode:
Use https://app.latest.flexpathdxp.com/

The agent should use an environment variable or config flag to select the correct base URL.

4. Link Generation Example
General (Get Pre-Qualified) Flow:

ruby
Copy
Edit
https://app.flexpathdxp.com/?dealerKey=ABC123&flow=GPQ&phone=234-567-8910&entry=CH&from=HP
Single Vehicle Payment Flow:

ruby
Copy
Edit
https://app.flexpathdxp.com/?dealerKey=ABC123&flow=SI&iidStub=1FTFW1E51PKD94357&phone=234-567-8910&entry=CH&from=IDP
All parameters must be URL-encoded and included in the query string. If a parameter is not available, it should be omitted unless required.

5. Agent Response Example
“You’re almost there! Click the secure link below to get pre-qualified for financing. This won’t affect your credit score, and you’ll see your best options instantly:
[FlexPath Link]”

If using inventory-specific flow, reference the vehicle in the message if possible.

6. Agent Steps (Pseudocode)
Check if required inputs are present:

If flow=SI, require both dealerKey and iidStub.

If flow=GPQ, require dealerKey.

Build query string with all available parameters (see above).

Select environment base URL (production or demo).

Generate full FlexPath link.

Insert link into customer response at the appropriate step.

Log or track every FlexPath handoff for analytics and auditing.

Handle errors gracefully (e.g., missing dealerKey or iidStub: do not attempt link, log and notify for follow-up).
