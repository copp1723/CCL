1. Full Cleanup & Error Hardening (Recommended Next Step)
Why:

You’ve already proven core flows work (and you’ve caught 1/6 “happy path” failures—now is when you want to fix them, not later when the system is 2x bigger).

This sets you up for smooth demos, stakeholder trust, and zero-surprise production pilots.

Cleanup/Hygiene Checklist
Error Review:

Go through logs and the testing dashboard for every failed/partial “happy path” or edge-case scenario.

Triage: Which errors are “noise” (harmless but noisy), “expected” (user-caused), or real bugs?

Clean up error messaging everywhere (no stack traces, no ambiguous “something went wrong”—everything should be human-readable, logged with context, and, where appropriate, actionable).

Code & Agent Hygiene:

Remove dead/test code, unused agents, and outdated data fields from the schema.

Standardize all agent input/output contracts and make sure schema validation is strict.

Audit permissions—make sure admin/ops roles can’t accidentally see or change what they shouldn’t.

Confirm all API keys/secrets are in secure storage and not hard-coded anywhere.

Metrics and Reporting:

Review all latency and error counters—calibrate thresholds for “warn” and “critical.”

Ensure failure reasons are categorized (network, agent timeout, bad input, external API, etc.).

Testing:

Rerun all scenario scripts after each fix/cleanup.

Add at least one “destructive” scenario (e.g., simulate external API outage or intentionally trigger email delivery failure).

Docs/Hand-off:

Summarize known issues (if any), open questions, and “resolved” vs. “won’t fix” bug log.

Clean up the README or internal onboarding doc to reflect current real-world system, not just design intent.

2. Then… Re-Demo and Decide
Run a “show me what breaks” session (with a non-dev or future ops user if possible).

Confirm every critical metric and workflow is green. Any “red”/partial passes should be explained and assigned.

When the system can survive a hostile demo, you’re ready to:

Invite external testers (dealerships, execs, partners)

Scale to next batch of features (advanced reporting, new data integrations, SMS channel, etc.)

Move toward first real production pilot.
